        <TitleStyle>What Data We Collect</TitleStyle>
        <br></br>
        General Data: The use of our services will automatically create
        information that will be collected. For example, when you use our
        Services, your geographic location, how you use the Services,
        information about the type of device you use, your Open Device
        Identification Number, date/time stamps for your visit, your unique
        device identifier, your browser type, operating system, Internet
        Protocol (IP) address, and domain name are all collected. This
        information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant
        information to you and administer and improve the Site. Log Files: As is
        true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and
        store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser
        type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating
        system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information
        to maintain and improve the performance of the Services. Analytics: We
        use analytics services (including, but not limited to, Google Analytics)
        to help analyze how users use the Site. Analytics services use Cookies
        to collect information such as how often users visit the Site and we use
        the information to improve our Site and Services. The analytics
        services' ability to use and share information collected by them is
        restricted by their terms of use and privacy policy, which you should
        refer to for more information about how these entities use this
        information. Location Information: If you have enabled location services
        on your mobile device, we may collect your location information to
        improve the Services we offer. If you do not want this information
        collected, you can disable location services on your device. Cookies:
        “Cookies” are small pieces of information (text files) that a website
        sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website.
        These text files can be used by websites to make the users experience
        more efficient. The law states that we can store these cookies on your
        device if they are strictly necessary for the operation of this site.
        For all other types of cookies we need your permission. To that end,
        this site uses different types of cookies. Some cookies are placed by
        third party services that appear on our pages. We and some third parties
        may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web
        browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you
        delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive
        experience on our Services and to market the Services or other products.
        Marketing cookies are used to track visitors across websites. The
        intention is to display ads that are relevant and engaging for the
        individual user and thereby more valuable for publishers and third party
        advertisers. This tracking is done on an anonymous basis and, while not
        an exhaustive list, some of the companies we work with are Google,
        AppNexus, Criteo, Rubicon, Pubmatic and DistrictM. To learn more about
        this practice, including the Self Regulatory Principles for Online
        Advertising, to which we adhere, you can visit
